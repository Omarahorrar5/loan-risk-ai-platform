# Loan Risk AI Platform

End-to-end MLOps platform that predicts credit loan risk using a neural network, served via a REST API, containerized with Docker, deployed on AWS EC2, and delivered through a full CI/CD pipeline — built as a portfolio project to demonstrate DevOps and MLOps practices.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| ML Model | PyTorch MLP — trained on 32k credit risk records |
| Backend | FastAPI — REST API with input validation and logging |
| Frontend | React + Vite — served via nginx |
| Database | PostgreSQL — predictions persisted across sessions |
| Containers | Docker + docker-compose |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions — test → build → push to Docker Hub |
| Infrastructure | Terraform — AWS EC2, VPC, subnets, security groups |
| Registry | Docker Hub |

---

## Features

- Credit risk prediction (SAFE / RISKY) with probability score
- Batch prediction endpoint — multiple applicants in one request
- Real-time dashboard with metrics, charts, and prediction history
- Data persisted in PostgreSQL — survives container restarts
- Automated CI/CD — every push triggers tests and rebuilds Docker images
- Infrastructure as Code — one command to provision and deploy on AWS
- nginx reverse proxy with React Router support

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and docker-compose installed
- AWS CLI configured (for deployment)
- Terraform installed (for deployment)

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omarahorrar/loan-risk-ai-platform
cd loan-risk-ai-platform
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost**

### Deploy to AWS

```bash
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Terraform provisions the EC2 instance, installs Docker, pulls the images from Docker Hub, and starts the full stack automatically. The public IP is printed in the outputs.

### Destroy infrastructure

```bash
cd infra
terraform destroy
```

## ML Model

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Algorithm | Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) |
| Framework | PyTorch |
| Architecture | 11 → 256 → 128 → 64 → 32 → 1 |
| Dataset | 32,581 credit risk records |
| Train / Test split | 80 / 20 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.90 |
| Risky Recall | 79% |
| Decision threshold | 0.4 (optimized for recall over precision) |
| Imbalance handling | pos_weight (78% safe / 22% risky) |
| Epochs | 60 |

The threshold is set to 0.4 instead of 0.5 — in credit risk, missing a risky loan (false negative) is more costly than flagging a safe one (false positive).

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

Every push to `main` triggers the following pipeline in GitHub Actions:

```
1. Checkout code
2. Install Python dependencies
3. Run pytest (7 tests — routes, validation, prediction shape)
      ↓ fails here if tests don't pass — nothing gets deployed
4. Login to Docker Hub
5. Build backend image  → push as omarahorrar/loan-risk-backend:latest + :sha
6. Build frontend image → push as omarahorrar/loan-risk-frontend:latest + :sha
```

Pull requests run tests only — images are only pushed on merge to `main`.
